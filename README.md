Just a quick update, I have planned out a much larger project that will incorporate numerous things instead of just doing one offs. I am making it so any machine with the vulnerability will automatically return the shell it is able to. 
First is eternal blue. Having to nail down the list of things that are vulnerable and incorporate a fully working exploit without metasploit is tough. I have a couple, but will have to almost entirely rewrite them for my purpose. 
I may just try to rewrite the metasploit version to work with python. 
This will go toward doing exploit development in my progression as well so it seems well worth it. But, I have next to nothing to show for it at this time other than running the nmap, checking the list is all background stuff so it doesn't seem worth it to post that at the moment.
